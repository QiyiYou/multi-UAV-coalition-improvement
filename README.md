# Multi-UAV Coalition Capability through Performance Modeling

The task is to develop an online performance modeling technique that estimates the capability of a UAV to
perform a task within a coalition, and show that this estimate converges to the true capability. Simulation results
demonstrate that forming coalitions using the proposed performance model improves mission time and reduces the
number of deployed resources.

# Steps

1. Run mainSimCentralBDA.m
2. Assign number of targets to the nTargets variable.
